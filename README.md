# FrontendMentor

This is my repo for some startup projects taken from the Frontend Mentor website in their Challenge section.

## Intro - Me first! :stuck_out_tongue: :metal: :skull:

I'm Fabio from Brazil and a **mathematician** with a lot of teaching experience. Recently, I was forced to change my career, and now I've started learning and practicing in `web development` area.

This decision was made not at random, but because I have a lot of programming experience too. In my professor career, I had to learn different programming languages like: C, C++, C#, Python, Matlab, R, and FORTRAN (but I prefer forget that I had learned this last). Mainly, I learned these languages because my work with Structural Analysis and Optimization, so I developed a ton of codes to solve structures, with Finite Element Analysis, for example; and other several optimizations codes like Simplex and EGO - Efficient Global Optimization.

Now, one friend of my, came to me and said: "see, you have to learn React, It's awesome". And, how I am weak to the word "learn", here I am, like a hurricane :notes:

So, welcome to this humble repo, where I want to share my tries to the challenges projects of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) site.

Feel free to give me some advice and help in some broken code or fast ways to do something. It will be a pleasure share knowledge...
